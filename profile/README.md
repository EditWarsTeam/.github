# Edit Wars

Edit Wars is a project using the analysis of media publications accompanying the growing militarization and manipulation of mass consciousness in Russia for a better understanding of the mechanics of state propaganda and ways to build resilience towards it. The project focus on the use of aggressive narratives in the government-controlled media that isolate public perception from the real state of affairs

The project consists of two parts. The research combines the use of quantitative and qualitative methods of working with data from large datasets to draw meaningful conclusions for the presentation. The artistic part of the project aims to put the findings into a multimedia interactive medium. 

We are open to partnerships with publishers, media and fact-checking organizations.

## Objectives

- To deconstruct Russian propaganda narratives through data research
- To create data analysis tools for the content investigation of the headlines in Russian online media
- To study the dynamics of the use of thematic markers, the presence of propaganda narratives in the headlines, as well as the temporal relationship between events and their media coverage
- To promote critical thinking and build resilience to misinformation and its reproduction.
- To develop artistic interpretation and embodiment of the research insights to offer new ways of perceiving the material.

## Research Metodology

The first iteration of the project is based on data analysis of propaganda narratives created and reproduced by the Russian digital media from January to July 2022. The methodology we developed allows us to replicate the results of our research and contains algorithms for working with data from the source to the end result. We encourage stakeholders to use it as a basis for their own research on propaganda narratives.

## Research Tools 

By using GDELT Global Difference Graph (GDG) databases, we analyzed more than 250,000 headlines of Russian-language media publications. We used machine learning tools (in particular, the BERTopic algorithm) to thematically clusterize data and to obtain relevant topics with the dynamics of their change. Additionally, we also applied Tableau to discover typical words and phrases of propaganda. Finally, we extracted word connections in headlines and visualized the resulting network graph using Spacy library.
